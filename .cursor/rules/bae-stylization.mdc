The app name "bae" is always stylized in lowercase as "bae", never "Bae" or "BAE". This applies to all user-visible strings in the app and website, including:
- UI text and labels
- Documentation
- Error messages
- Window titles
- Button text
- Alt text
- Meta descriptions

Exceptions:
- File names and directory names may use any case (e.g., "Bae.dmg", "Bae Library")
- Code identifiers (variables, functions, types) may use any case as appropriate for the language's conventions
- URLs and protocol names (e.g., "bae://") should use lowercase
