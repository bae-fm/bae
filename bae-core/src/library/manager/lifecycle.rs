//! Library-lifecycle operations for [`LibraryManager`]: rename a library,
//! lock it (forget the active encryption key), and forget a local library
//! (drop the master key, clear the active-library pointer, and remove its
//! data directory). These mutate the library's on-disk presence and the
//! active-library pointer — distinct from the config-access surface in
//! `config.rs`, which only reads and writes config fields.
