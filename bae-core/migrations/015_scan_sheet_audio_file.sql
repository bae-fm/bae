-- The scan settles which audio each track sheet describes, but the cached
-- scan kept only whether it did: every reader resolved the sheet's FILE
-- directives again. The pairing is now stored, one row per FILE reference in
-- the sheet's order, so a bound sheet reads as the audio it names. An
-- override's single file moves there too, so scan_candidate_file drops
-- sheet_binding_file_id — which its CHECKs reference, so the table is rebuilt.
-- Cached scans hold the old shape, so remove them while retaining
-- watched_import_folders and all import edits; the scanner rebuilds these
-- device-local rows from their watched roots.
