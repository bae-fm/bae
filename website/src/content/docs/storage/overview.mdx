description: How bae stores your music files
---

Bae gives you full control over where your music is stored. You can manage storage yourself, or let bae handle it for you.

## Storage Options

**Self-managed storage**: Point bae at files you already have organized. Bae indexes them but doesn't move or copy anything.

**Bae-managed storage**: Let bae organize and store your files. When you import music, bae copies it to your configured storage location.

## Storage Locations

Storage can be:

- **Local**: A folder on your computer or external drive
- **Remote**: S3-compatible cloud storage (AWS S3, MinIO, Backblaze B2, etc.)

Both options support optional encryption—your files are encrypted before they leave your machine.

## How It Works

1. You create **storage profiles** in Settings
2. When importing a release, you pick which profile to use
3. Bae copies the files to that storage location
4. The release is now associated with that storage configuration

Each release stores its own copy of the storage settings. This means you can have different releases in different locations—some local, some in the cloud, some unmanaged.
