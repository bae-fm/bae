description: Creating and managing storage profiles
---

Storage profiles are templates that define where and how to store music. You create profiles in Settings, then select one when importing releases.

## Creating a Profile

Go to **Settings → Storage** and click **Add Profile**. Configure:

- **Name**: A label for this profile (e.g., "Local SSD", "AWS Backup")
- **Type**: Local folder or S3-compatible storage
- **Location**: The folder path or S3 bucket details
- **Encryption**: Whether to encrypt files (recommended for cloud storage)

## Profile as Template

When you import a release and select a storage profile, bae copies that profile's settings to the release. The release now has its own independent storage configuration.

**Important**: If you later update a profile, existing releases using that profile are not affected. Their storage configuration was set at import time.

This design means:
- You can safely edit profiles without breaking existing imports
- Each release is self-contained with its own storage settings
- You can delete a profile after importing without losing access to those releases

## Changing a Release's Storage

To move a release to different storage:

1. Open the release in your library
2. Go to release settings
3. Select a different storage profile (or "Unstored" to remove from managed storage)
4. Bae migrates the files in the background

Migration copies files to the new location, verifies them, then removes the old copies. Your music remains playable throughout.

## Unstored Releases

Choosing "Unstored" means bae stops managing the files for that release. Use this for:
- Music you manage yourself
- Releases you want to remove from cloud storage
- Temporary imports you don't want to keep
