Rip your physical CDs directly in Bae. No external software needed.

## Requirements

- A CD/DVD drive (internal or USB)
- macOS: No additional setup required

## How to rip a CD

1. Insert a CD into your drive
2. Click **Import** in the sidebar
3. Select **CD**
4. Bae reads the disc and looks up the album on MusicBrainz

The lookup uses the CD's table of contents (TOC) to find an exact match.

## Output format

CDs are ripped to **FLAC** (lossless) by default. This preserves full CD quality while compressing the file size.

## Metadata

When Bae finds a match on MusicBrainz:

- Track names and durations are filled in
- Artist and album info is downloaded
- Album artwork is fetched

If no exact match is found, you can search manually by album name.

## Accuracy

Bae uses AccurateRip to verify your rips match other users' copies. This ensures you get bit-perfect copies of your CDs.
