Import music files you already have on your computer.

## Supported formats

Bae supports common audio formats:

- **Lossless**: FLAC, WAV, AIFF, ALAC
- **Lossy**: MP3, AAC, OGG, Opus

## How to import

1. Click **Import** in the sidebar
2. Select **Local Files**
3. Choose a folder containing an album
4. Bae scans and identifies the tracks

## Metadata matching

After scanning, Bae shows potential matches from:

- **Discogs** - Great for vinyl releases, credits, and catalog numbers
- **MusicBrainz** - Comprehensive database with detailed track info

Select the release that best matches your files. Bae uses this to:

- Download album artwork
- Fill in artist, album, genre, year
- Get track names and durations
- Store release-specific info (barcode, label, etc.)

## File organization

When you import, Bae copies files to your library folder organized as:

```
~/Music/Bae Library/
  Artist Name/
    Album Title (Year)/
      01 - Track Name.flac
      02 - Track Name.flac
      ...
      cover.jpg
```

Your original files are left untouched.

## Bulk import

You can select a folder containing multiple albums. Bae will scan recursively and let you import each album individually.
