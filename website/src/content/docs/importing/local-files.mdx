Import music files you already have on your computer.

## Supported formats

Bae supports common audio formats:

- **Lossless**: FLAC, WAV, AIFF, ALAC
- **Lossy**: MP3, AAC, OGG, Opus

## How to import

1. Click **Import** in the sidebar
2. Select **Local Files**
3. Choose a folder containing an album
4. Bae scans and identifies the tracks

## Metadata matching

After scanning, Bae shows potential matches from:

- **Discogs** - Great for vinyl releases, credits, and catalog numbers
- **MusicBrainz** - Comprehensive database with detailed track info

Select the release that best matches your files. Bae uses this to:

- Download album artwork
- Fill in artist, album, genre, year
- Get track names and durations
- Store release-specific info (barcode, label, etc.)

## Storage options

When importing, you choose how bae stores the files:

- **Bae-managed storage**: Bae copies files to your configured storage location (local folder or cloud)
- **Self-managed**: Bae indexes your existing files without moving them

If using bae-managed storage, you select a [storage profile](/storage/profiles) during import. This determines where files are copied and whether they're encrypted.

Your original files are always left untouched.

See [Storage Overview](/storage/overview) for more on storage options.

## Bulk import

You can select a folder containing multiple albums. Bae will scan recursively and let you import each album individually.
