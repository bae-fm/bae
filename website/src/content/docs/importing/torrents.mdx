Bae has a built-in torrent client. Download and import in one step.

## How to import from torrent

1. Click **Import** in the sidebar
2. Select **Torrent**
3. Paste a magnet link or select a `.torrent` file
4. Bae starts downloading and shows progress

Once complete, the import flow continues like a local file import—match to a release and add to your library.

## Features

- **Built-in client** - No need for external torrent software
- **Sequential download** - Prioritizes downloading in order
- **Automatic cleanup** - Removes torrent data after import

## Privacy

The torrent client uses your default network connection. If you use a VPN, torrent traffic goes through it.

## Network settings

In Settings, you can configure:

- **Bind interface** - Restrict torrents to a specific network interface
- **Port** - Change the listening port (default: random)

## Supported sites

Bae works with magnet links and `.torrent` files from any source. Just paste the magnet link or drag in the torrent file.
